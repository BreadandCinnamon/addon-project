The Referee rank is the first rank within the event staff team.

#### Description

Referees are the bridging gap between the senior event staff team and the community. As referees, they represent the network and are tasked to carry out various jobs. Primarily, they are tasked to handle their assigned teams during tournament day. Referees help direct teams to their corresponding assigned servers and assist teams when needed. Referees are an integral part of the events network and are lead by the senior events staff.

#### Requirements

When tournaments are announced, it can be expected that referee applications will be opened. During this period, interested players can apply for the position and their applications will be reviewed and vetted by the event staff team. If successful, these players will become a group of new referees known as temporary referees. These referees are monitored by the senior staff team and they may be added to the permanent referee team if they perform well. As referees of a tournament, they are not allowed to play in the tournament.
