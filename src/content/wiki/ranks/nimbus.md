This rank was given to players who complete the 2017 Halloween Head Hunt.

#### Description

The Nimbus rank is very similar to the [Alto rank](ranks/alto). Players with this rank can fly in the lobby, choose their own team and a 2.0x droplet multiplier, although are not allowed to choose their own teams. Unlike the Alto ranks, players are also given 3 set-next [tokens](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/guides/(https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/tokens) and 1 mutation token. The rank was given out to players on December 17th, 2017, and is expected to last the remainder on the year.

This rank was awarded to players who completed [Wave 1](https://stratus.network/forums/topics/59e08fb7b393290001000095?page=1#59e099c03794ba0001000002) of the 2017 Halloween activities, which was a head hunt.
