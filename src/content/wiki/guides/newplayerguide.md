#### Welcome!

Hello and welcome to the Stratus Network! We are very glad you found us!. The Stratus Network is a PvP based server run on the [PGM](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/pgm) plugin. The server provides unique, dynamic maps and [gamemodes](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/gamemodes) created by the dedicated members of our awesome community.

#### Selection Menu

When you log into the server, your hotbar will contain a selection of items that each serve a special purpose when clicked.

![Hotbar 1](../../assets/img/newplayerguide/hotbar1.png)

The first item is the World Edit compass. This compass will allow you to teleport throughout the map as long as you are spectating it. You left click to teleport to the object you are looking at, and right click to pass through blocks.

The second item is team selector. Clicking this opens a menu that allows you to join the match or to choose your team. Keep in mind that choosing teams and joining full teams requires a donator rank which can be purchased in the [Stratus store](https://stratusnetwork.buycraft.net/). You can also join the match by typing /join. You can return to observer mode at any time in the match by typing /obs. This will take you out of the match, and rejoining will send you back to the spawn with the default kit.

Once open, the inventory will display a selection menu. The chainmail helmet will put you onto the team with the fewest players. If you have a [legacy rank](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/legacyranks), you can choose which team you wish to join by clicking on one of the leather helmets.

The third item is the tutorial emerald. Not all maps have this option, however, the ones that do are a great place for beginners to start. This item will take you through a custom tutorial about the map. All tutorials are unique to the map you are currently playing, so if you have not played the map before, it is highly recommended that you view this. The tutorial itself will send you to specific locations through the map with information in the chat box. Left click the emerald to go to the next location, and right click to return to the previous one. You can always leave the match to view the tutorial if you are confused on what you must do.

The fourth item is the menu. Under the menu, you have access to the token menu, your stats, and some settings.

[Tokens]((https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/tokens)) are special items that allow you to set a poll for the next map or for a mutation. Tokens can be purchased in the Stratus store or bought using droplets. Tokens can also be obtained by purchasing a [legacy rank](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/legacyranks). There is a chance of receiving either a SetNext or Mutation token at the end of every match. You will be alerted in chat if you are a lucky recipient. Those on the winning team, and the [MVP](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/mvp), will automatically have a higher chance of receiving a token.

You can configure your settings as well. These fall under three categories; Chat, Gameplay, and Miscellaneous. This is very similar to the /toggle command, yet much more organized and appealing to the eyes. 

![Inventory 3](../../assets/img/newplayerguide/inventory3.png)

Upon clicking on the token icon, you are taken to this screen. Here, you can select a SetNext or Mutation token. SetNext tokens will allow you to set a poll for the next map, if the poll succeeds, the map will be played and the token consumed. The mutation poll functions in the same way, and will set a mutation in the next match if the poll succeeds. The emerald icon in the center will take you to the token shop.

![Inventory 5](../../assets/img/newplayerguide/inventory5.png)

This is the token shop where you can buy one, three, or five of either SetNext or Mutation tokens, consuming droplets. The ghast tear icon shows how many droplets you have, and the emerald displays the Stratus Shop link. You can go back to the previous screen by clicking on the red wool.

![Hotbar 5](../../assets/img/newplayerguide/hotbar5.png)

The fifth and final icon is the Navigation bar. This allows you to transport to other servers or the lobby. 

![Inventory 7](../../assets/img/newplayerguide/inventory7.png)

This is the server selection screen. It also shows how many people are in each server (there were 5 people in Beta when this photo was taken).
