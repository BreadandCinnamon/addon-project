#### Description

Capture the Flag, or CTF is a gamemode where the objective is to steal an enemy's flag and return it to your side. In that sense, it is very similar to [CTW](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/gamemodes/ctw), with the biggest different being that there is only one flag per flag objective (ex: Flag A, Flag B, etc.). Flags will be located on a designated platform, and will always return to that platform upon respawn. In order to successfully capture a flag, you must take it from an enemy's platform and return it to your own (some maps require flags to be brought to spawn instead). In some cases, you cannot capture an enemy's flag unless your flag is on your platform. The game is won once a team has captured the required flag(s) a certain amount of times.

#### Flag

The flag is a banner that is colored coded to the team that owns it. When someone is carrying the flag it shows up in their head armor slot, and it is visible above their player avatar. There are also particles above the player's head that follow the player to indicate that they have the flag. In order to pick up the flag you must walk over the banner. If you are killed while carrying the flag, it will be placed the spot where you died. When the flag is “dropped” it will stay on the ground as a block until picked up. If the flag is not picked up by a certain amount of time (designated by a timer above the flag block), the flag will respawn back to the flag platform.

#### Variants of Capture the Flag

##### King of the Flag

This variant is a bit different from the traditional CTF. In this gamestyle, the flag will generate points to the team who holds it. To win, a team requires a player to capture and hold the flag. Team members defend that player from getting killed, since the flag will be dropped upon death, and will only be available to pick up at the flag platform. If a player dies while their team is holding the flag, they cannot respawn until the teammate holding the flag is killed, or the game ends with their team winning. Games are won once a team reaches a specific point amount.

#### Trivia

- Capture the Flag was introduced to Overcast in 2014
- After a patch in PGM, when the player carrying the flag is killed, the flag will drop a banner of the same color and design. This is currently a glitch that hasn't been fixed yet and it appears that this bug will not be fixed in the near future
- Because of this bug, it is possible to pick up and place the dropped flags on certain maps, or even craft them into shields
- Capture the Flag is often mistaken for Capture the Wool
- Flags can alternatively be dropped by removing it from the head armour slot (similar to taking off a helment)
